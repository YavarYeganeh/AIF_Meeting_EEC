This project explores **deep active inference**, an emerging field that combines **deep learning** with the **active inference** decision-making framework. Leveraging a deep active inference agent, we focus on **controlling** **parallel and identical machine workstations** to **enhance energy efficiency**. We address challenges posed by the problem's stochastic nature and delayed policy response by introducing tailored enhancements.

- The project is based on a **[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09322)** presented and accepted in the proceedings of the***10th International Conference on machine Learning, Optimization and Data science (LOD '24)***.

#### Key Contributions:

- **Deep Active-Inference-Based Agent:** With active inference integrating perception, learning, and action, the agent is tailored and enhanced for optimizing machine control in the stochastic manufacturing environment with delayed policy response.
- **Hybrid Horizon and Multi-Step Transition Methods:** These enhancements allow the agent to improve prediction and planning for longer horizons without computational burden.
- **Performance:** Experimental results show the effectiveness of enhancements compared to the existing agents as well as the potential of the proposed methodology. Notably, the agent achieved high rewards with simple one-step repeated multi-transition lookaheads.
